## Abstract
The project focuses on leveraging predictive analytics to optimize the availability of fitness classes at GoalZone. We observed a significant underutilization of booked spaces, leading to inefficiency and member dissatisfaction. Our solution employs data-driven methods to forecast class attendance accurately, enabling dynamic class capacity management.

## Data Description
The dataset includes various features such as Booking ID, Months as Member, Weight, Days Before, Day of Week, Time, Category, and Attendance status. We conducted a detailed exploratory data analysis, including univariate analysis, outlier treatment, and handling missing values, to understand and prepare the data for modeling.

## Methodology
We utilized a range of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees (pruned and unpruned), Random Forest, and XGBoost. These models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics to ensure robustness and reliability in attendance prediction.

## Key Results
- The models' performance was rigorously assessed, with emphasis on optimizing metrics like recall and precision based on the specific needs of GoalZone.
- The XGBoost model demonstrated high accuracy and a balanced approach in classifying attendance, making it a strong candidate for practical implementation.
- Our analysis provides actionable insights for GoalZone to enhance class management and member experience.

## Conclusion
The application of these models presents a potent approach for forecasting class attendance, which can significantly improve the management of class capacities at GoalZone. This project not only optimizes resource utilization but also contributes to a better overall experience for the club members.
